# MonteCarloTreeSearch_project
The first part of the project was to implement 2 games : the matches game and the famous 'connect 4' (Puisance 4).
- **The matches games** is quit simple : it involves 2 players and a bunch of matches. One player at a time can pick either 1, 2 or 3 matches. The player who picks the last match loses the game. 
- **The Connect 4** is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

The second part consists in taking a closer look at the algorithm MCTS. We tried to optimize it with better parameters and parallelisation (during the simulation phase first).
